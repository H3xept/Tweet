# Tweet
Tweet is a iOS tweak that lets you post on socials (Twitter and Facebook) directly from your LockScreen.

##How to use it
Tweet adds a little scroll view to your lockscreen, letting you choose between twitter and facebook interaction. 
If you press one of those, you will be shown a controller to create your post. 

Tweet comes with a notification handler: if you receive a notification, static scrollview of tweet would cover it, but a pop animation moves the twitter/facebook squares to the mid-left part of your screen, allowing you to drag them around and switch social type with a double tap.

If the notification view is for any reason dismissed, the draggable view returns scrollable and static.

##Compatibility
Tweet has been developed and tested on iPhone 5 mounting iOS 8.1.2 (12B440), i'm still fixing the version to work with iPhone 6, since there were some views issues.
